#Budget Manager App

#### Description:
The Budget Manager is a comprehensive web application developed using Python, Flask, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy, designed to provide users with a simple yet powerful way to track personal expenses, manage transactions, and gain insights into their spending habits. At its core, the application allows users to log transactions by entering a description of the purchase or expense, the amount spent, the category it falls under (such as food, utilities, transport, etc.), and the date of the transaction. This information is stored persistently in a local SQLite database, which enables users to retrieve and interact with their financial data even after closing the browser or restarting the app. The interface is built using HTML, Bootstrap, and custom CSS, ensuring a clean and responsive layout that works across devices. One of the standout features of the Budget Manager is its dynamic transaction table displayed on the main dashboard. Each transaction is listed in reverse chronological order, showing the description, amount (formatted as a currency), category, and date. Additionally, every entry includes buttons to edit or delete the transaction, offering full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. The "edit" option takes users to a pre-filled form that allows them to modify the details of an existing transaction, while the "delete" button prompts for confirmation before removing the entry from the database to prevent accidental deletions. These features demonstrate practical use of Flask routing and form handling as well as the integration of SQLAlchemy ORM for seamless database operations. Another critical feature of the application is the ability to view the total amount spent, calculated using SQLAlchemy’s func.sum() method to aggregate all transaction amounts in the database. This total is displayed prominently above the table, giving users immediate insight into their spending behavior and helping them make more informed financial decisions.

The application also includes a dark mode feature for improved accessibility and user comfort. This feature is implemented using JavaScript and CSS and provides users with a toggle button that switches the theme from light to dark and vice versa. The user’s preference is saved using the browser’s localStorage, ensuring that the selected theme persists even after a page reload or browser restart. This not only enhances the user experience but also introduces frontend interactivity into a primarily backend-focused application. The project’s architecture follows best practices for Flask development, with the main server logic centralized in the app.py file. All HTML views are organized under a templates/ directory using Jinja2 templating for dynamic content rendering, and static assets like CSS files are kept in a static/ directory to maintain separation of concerns and improve maintainability. From a technical perspective, the Budget Manager project solves several real-world challenges common to web development. It deals with handling and validating user input, safely performing database operations, rendering content conditionally based on user data, and implementing an interactive and accessible frontend.

The inclusion of edit and delete features adds a layer of complexity and depth to the project, requiring careful management of route parameters, HTTP methods (GET and POST), and conditional rendering. Moreover, the app context is managed explicitly to ensure that database actions like creating tables and committing transactions are executed within the correct scope, avoiding common Flask errors related to context misuse. While this version of the Budget Manager is designed for personal, single-user use, it sets the foundation for future expansion. For example, implementing user authentication would allow multiple people to manage separate budgets within the same application. Adding filters for categories, date ranges, or spending limits could provide users with more detailed control and analysis of their expenses. Visual components like pie charts or bar graphs could be added to help users visualize spending trends over time. Exporting transaction history as a CSV or PDF could enable users to keep offline records or share reports with others. These ideas represent just a few of the many directions in which the project could evolve, making it an ideal candidate for portfolio development or educational demonstration.

Overall, the Budget Manager exemplifies a well-rounded intermediate-level project that covers the full web development stack, from backend server logic and database integration to frontend interactivity and responsive design. It teaches key concepts like form validation, data persistence, RESTful routing, stateful frontend behavior, and user experience design—all while delivering a practical and usable application. Whether used as a personal tool or as a foundation for more advanced financial software, the Budget Manager provides a meaningful opportunity to build, learn, and extend real-world programming skills in Python and Flask.
